# Portfolio Webpage  

## Overview  
The **Portfolio Webpage** is a responsive, modern, and fully customizable website built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It serves as both a **professional showcase** of my projects, skills, and education, and a **technical demonstration** of my growing frontend development abilities.  

This portfolio highlights my journey as a **Chemical Engineering and Computer Science dual-degree student** at the **University of Wyoming**, combining analytical problem-solving with clean software design. It’s the centerpiece of my online presence — designed for scalability, readability, and maintainability, while reflecting my professional brand.

## Design and Development 

- Design & Setup	Project foundation	Planned layout, typography, and color scheme. Initialized React + TypeScript project with Tailwind.
- Component Building	Modular UI	Built reusable, composable components (Navbar, ProjectCard, Footer).
- Dynamic Data Integration	JSON-driven content	Added structured data for projects and skills.
- SEO & Optimization	Performance tuning	Lazy-loaded images, minimized assets, and optimized metadata.
- Deployment	GitHub Pages	Continuous integration with GitHub and preparation for a .com domain.

## Performance Highlights

- Responsive across all devices and resolutions.
- Accessible with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- Optimized with Tailwind’s JIT compilation and asset minification.
- SEO-ready with meta descriptions, structured data, and page titles.

## Future Enhancements

- Add dark/light mode toggle with user preference persistence.

- Introduce 3D or interactive visualizations (using Three.js).

- Implement a custom backend for the blog and analytics.

- Integrate a visitor dashboard (view counts, country stats).

- Add i18n (internationalization) for multilingual support.
